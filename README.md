# A Trustless System for Communal Purchase

This project provides the framework of a decentralized system for the communal purchase of real-world assets. The front-end is a basic web-app using ReactJS for the front-end and a smart contract coded in Solidity for the back-end, which is responsible for giving associated wallets an NFT that entitles them to their share of the order. This NFT can be compared to a receipt that you would get at a store, except it can not be duplicated, forged, or lost.
